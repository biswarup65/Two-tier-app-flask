# üê≥ Containerized Two-Tier Web Application using Docker & Docker Compose

## üìò Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **containerize a two-tier web application** (a frontend web app and a backend database) using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.  
Additionally, it showcases how to perform **image vulnerability scanning** using **Docker Scout**, helping ensure that the application is both **secure** and **efficient**.

By completing this project, you‚Äôll gain **hands-on experience** with:
- Docker containerization  
- Multi-container orchestration using Docker Compose  
- Networking between containers  
- Image vulnerability scanning and remediation using Docker Scout

# üê≥ Containerized Two-Tier Web Application using Docker & Docker Compose

## üìò Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **containerize a two-tier web application** (a frontend web app and a backend database) using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.  
Additionally, it showcases how to perform **image vulnerability scanning** using **Docker Scout**, helping ensure that the application is both **secure** and **efficient**.

By completing this project, you‚Äôll gain **hands-on experience** with:
- Docker containerization  
- Multi-container orchestration using Docker Compose  
- Networking between containers  
- Image vulnerability scanning and remediation using Docker Scout  

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Docker** | For creating and managing containers |
| **Docker Compose** | For defining and running multi-container applications |
| **Docker Scout** | For scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities |
| **Code Editor (VS Code, Atom, etc.)** | For writing and managing source code |
| **Two-Tier Application Source Code** | A simple web app with a database backend (e.g., Flask + MySQL) |

---
## üéØ Project Objectives

- Containerize both tiers of the application (frontend & database).  
- Use Docker Compose to run both containers together as one stack.  
- Ensure proper network communication between containers.  
- Use Docker Scout to identify and mitigate image vulnerabilities.

## üß™ Scanning Images with Docker Scout

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker Scout (if not already available):
``` bash
docker scout version

```
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scan Images for Vulnerabilities:
``` bash
docker scout cves two-tier-flask-app:latest
```
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ View Recommendations and Fixes:
``` bash
Docker Scout provides detailed vulnerability reports and patch recommendations.
```
